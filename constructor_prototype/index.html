    <h2>Object-Based Programming</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript supports object-based program design. (It also supports imperative and functional program designs.[1])

        The purpose of an object-based design is to allow the components to be as modular as possible. In particular, when a new object type is created, it is expected that it should work without problem when placed in a different environment or new programming project. The benefits of this approach are a shorter development time and easier debugging, because you're re-using program code that has already been proven. This 'black box' approach means that data goes into the Object and other data comes out of the Object, but what goes on inside isn't something you need to concern yourself with.
